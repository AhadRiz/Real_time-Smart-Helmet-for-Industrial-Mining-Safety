Industrial and mining environments expose workers to multiple life-threatening hazards such as toxic gas leaks, extreme temperatures, high humidity, and accidental falls. This project presents the design and implementation of a Real-Time Smart Helmet using an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with DHT22, MQ-7, and MPU6050 sensors. 
The system continuously monitors environmental and physiological conditions and triggers a multi-stage alert mechanism when risk thresholds are violated.
The alert sequence includes buzzer activation, followed by worker confirmation via pushbutton, and activates the vibration motor and emergency SOS transmission via WiFi to a command center if no response is detected within 10 seconds.
The system demonstrates a complete IoT-based safety solution using sensor integration, FreeRTOS multitasking, WiFi communication, and emergency decision-making logic.
